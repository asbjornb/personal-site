# Inspiration for this site

I've long been fascinated with zettelkasten, personal wikis, gtd and similar but never committed. Finding [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) gave me an easy way to try it out and I collected some simple notes. Reading more blogposts this one really resonated with me: [Building a digital Garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) - give it a read and see if you agree.

## A digital garden

Quoting [Maggie Appleton](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners):
>A garden is something in between a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ posts are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web.

## The technical stuff

As many others in the note-taking/static-site/mind-garden space I didn't want to lock myself into some proprietary software. So Foam is just some small set of markdown utilities, but all my notes and website content exists only as markdown files. If I get sick of 11ty or Foam I can take my content elsewhere without much ado.

## Longer term

So far I still need to figure out some stuff. I'm not great at javascript so building a note-graph would be a challenge (though probably a fun one). Also I'd love to setup commenting for some parts of this site, but haven't yet settled on a great way to do just that. For now [my github](https://github.com/asbjornb/personal-site) is the best interaction point. As is apparent, my design sense is also certainly unrefined (well just crap).
