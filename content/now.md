# Now

## :house: Personal

* Recently had a 2 months playthrough of [Create Above and Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YicXdyDFWuw)
* Kids are growing up damn fast. Pondering taking early days off work once a week for dedicated one-on-one daddy time
* Paternity leave soon. Trips booked with friends and family, but also have some overdue home-improvement projects

## :dollar: Work

* Getting back into C# after years of sql, adf, data warehousing
* Fiddling with some functional concepts inspired by Alexis Kings [Parse, don't validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/) and Zoran Horvats walkthrough of an [Option type in C#](https://codinghelmet.com/articles/custom-implementation-of-the-option-maybe-type-in-cs). Still need to get the last pieces into place
* Hoping to replace some ETL which is currently in SSIS and DBA-tools with a more homemade setup in .net - maybe via [bulk writer](https://headspringlabs.github.io/bulk-writer/)

## :computer: Tech

* Building this 11ty site
* Revisiting [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). See my repo at [github](https://github.com/asbjornb/small-code-challenges)

## :books: Reading

* Code that fits in your head by [Mark Seemann](https://blog.ploeh.dk/about/). Great so far - read the first 2/3's in a week, but now I'm taking some time off and digesting
