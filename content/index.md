# Hi

I'm Asbj√∏rn Brandt. A developer, data-enthusiast, father, husband, nerd and a life long learner. I love learning new things and this site is just another attempt at trying out new tech rather than just reading about it.

I previously blogged a bit on personal finance over at [firedk.com](https://firedk.com/blog/) but learned quickly that I just write when I have time and inspiration rather than try to publish on a schedule. This site will run with that observation rather than try to be something it's not. So don't expect posts with dates - rather see this as a [mind garden](inspiration).

To get in touch just reach out at asbjoernbrandt@gmail.com
